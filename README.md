## Overview

SoGit is a full-stack web application built with React, React Router, and React Bootstrap for the front end. It integrates with Auth0 for user authentication and fetches news articles from a backend API.

## Features

- **News Search:** Users can search for news articles by keywords.
- **Article Likes:** Users can like or unlike articles.
- **Article Comments:** Users can comment on articles.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and mobile-friendly.

## Getting Started:
To get started with SoGit on your local machine, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js: You'll need Node.js to run the application and its dependencies.

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is used to manage project dependencies.

NPM is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.
Git: You'll need Git to clone the project repository.

Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/.

**Installation
Now that you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to set up SoGit on your local machine:

**Clone the project repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sogit.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

**Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd sogit
Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

**Create a .env file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your-news-api-key
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=your-backend-api-url
Replace your-auth0-domain, your-auth0-client-id, your-news-api-key, and your-backend-api-url with the appropriate values.

**Start the development server:
